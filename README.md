# California Wildfire Impact On Home Insurance Premium
Dataset:
This dataset contains information about home insurance and wildfire risk in different ZIP codes across California. It includes average coverage amounts for buildings (Coverage A) and personal items (Coverage C), the average fire risk score for each area, and how many homes fall into different fire risk levels. It also shows how much insurance companies earned in premiums and how much they paid out in claims, both for regular and major (catastrophic) fire and smoke damage. This data can help analyze how wildfire risk affects insurance prices and predict future premiums.
Note: This dataset is obtained from the calfiornia department of insurance (https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/DataAnalysisOnWildfiresAndInsurance.cfm).

##Objectives:
1. To perform in-depth exploratory data analysis of the both datasets (tabular and graph)
To engineer new predictive features from the available graphs
To develop a supervised model to classify behaviour into normal and anomalous
